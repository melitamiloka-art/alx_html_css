# CSS Advanced – ALX Frontend Project

This project builds upon the **HTML Advanced** project by focusing entirely on **CSS styling**, layout structure, responsiveness, and visual fidelity based on a Figma design.

##  Objectives

The goal of this project is to:

- Implement a complete webpage using **semantic HTML** and **advanced CSS**.
- Reproduce a full design from **Figma**, following spacing, layout, colors, typography, and component styles.
- Use **flexbox**, **grid**, **custom fonts**, **background images**, and **responsive design techniques**.
- Enhance the HTML (from the previous Advanced HTML project) by adding necessary attributes, images, alt tags, class names, and structure for styling.
- Maintain a clean file structure and follow best practices for frontend development.
